## Sequence in Python

- A sequence in Python is an ordered collection of items, where each item holds a relative position. Common examples of sequences include strings, lists, tuples, bytearrays, buffers, and range objects.
- The most common sequence in Python is the list. A list is a collection of items that are ordered and mutable, meaning that they can be changed.
- Tuples are another type of sequence in Python. Tuples are similar to lists, but they are immutable
- Strings are a type of sequence in Python that represent text. Strings are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed.

- List are Mutable Sequences
- Can be iterated using loops

### The enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object (iterator with index and the value).
